# ChatterBuddy Voice Setup Instructions

## 🎯 What's Been Implemented

Your React Native app now has **WebRTC-based OpenAI Realtime API integration** with:

- ✅ **Start/End Call Button** at the bottom of the screen
- ✅ **3D Avatar Integration** with voice state indicators
- ✅ **Real-time Voice Conversation** with OpenAI GPT-4o
- ✅ **Live Transcript Display** showing what the AI is saying
- ✅ **Connection Status Indicator** in the top-right corner
- ✅ **Microphone Permissions** handling for Android/iOS

## 🔧 Required Setup Steps

### 1. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project root with your OpenAI API key:

```bash
# Create .env file
GPT_MODEL_KEY=sk-proj-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
```

**Get your API key from:** https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

**Important:** Make sure your API key has access to the realtime API models!

### 2. Install Dependencies

All required packages have been installed:

- ✅ `react-native-webrtc` - WebRTC functionality
- ✅ `react-native-config` - Environment variables
- ✅ `react-native-permissions` - Permission handling

### 3. Android Setup (Already Done)

The following permissions have been added to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

- ✅ `RECORD_AUDIO` - Microphone access
- ✅ `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` - Audio configuration
- ✅ `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` - Network connectivity
- ✅ `WAKE_LOCK` - Keep device awake during calls

### 4. Build and Run

```bash
# For Android
npx react-native run-android

# For iOS (you may need to run pod install first)
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
npx react-native run-ios
```

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Launch the app** - You'll see your 3D humanoid robot avatar
2. **Tap "Start Call"** at the bottom - The app will request microphone permission
3. **Start talking** - The AI will respond in real-time using voice
4. **See live transcript** - Text appears at the bottom showing what the AI is saying
5. **End call** - Tap "End Call" to stop the conversation

## 🔧 Features

### Visual Indicators

- **Green Button**: Ready to start call
- **Orange Button**: Connecting...
- **Red Button**: End active call
- **Status Dot**: Shows connection state (green = connected, orange = connecting)
- **Live Transcript**: Shows AI responses in real-time

### Avatar States

- **Listening**: Avatar indicates when you're speaking
- **Talking**: Avatar indicates when AI is responding
- **Idle**: Default state when not in conversation

## 🚨 Important Security Notes

**⚠️ PRODUCTION WARNING:** The current implementation includes your API key in the client app for testing. This is **NOT RECOMMENDED** for production!

### For Production:

1. Create a secure backend server
2. Move API key to your backend
3. Use the backend to generate ephemeral keys
4. Update `OpenAIBackendService.ts` to call your backend instead

## 📱 Supported Models

- ✅ `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview` (default, cost-effective)
- ✅ `gpt-4o-realtime-preview` (more capable, higher cost)

## 🎯 Customization Options

You can customize the AI personality by editing the `instructions` in `AvatarScreen.tsx`:

```typescript
instructions: 'You are a helpful, friendly AI assistant named ChatterBuddy. Respond naturally and conversationally in a warm, engaging tone.',
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Configuration Error" Alert**

   - ✅ Make sure `.env` file exists with `GPT_MODEL_KEY=your-key`
   - ✅ Restart Metro bundler: `npx react-native start --reset-cache`

2. **"Microphone access denied"**

   - ✅ Check app permissions in device settings
   - ✅ Grant microphone permission manually if needed

3. **"Failed to establish WebRTC connection"**

   - ✅ Check internet connection
   - ✅ Verify API key has realtime API access
   - ✅ Check OpenAI service status

4. **Build errors on Android**

   - ✅ Clean build: `cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..`
   - ✅ Rebuild: `npx react-native run-android`

5. **iOS build issues**
   - ✅ Update pods: `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`
   - ✅ Clean build folder in Xcode

## 📋 Files Modified

- ✅ `src/components/AvatarScreen.tsx` - Added voice call UI and logic
- ✅ `src/services/OpenAIRealtimeService.ts` - WebRTC service implementation
- ✅ `src/services/OpenAIBackendService.ts` - API key management
- ✅ `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added permissions
- ✅ `package.json` - Added new dependencies

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

Your ChatterBuddy app is now ready for real-time voice conversations with OpenAI!

**Next Steps:**

1. Add your OpenAI API key to `.env`
2. Build and run the app
3. Tap "Start Call" and start talking!
