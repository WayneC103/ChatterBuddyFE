This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

# ChatterBuddy

This project uses React Native with Three.js to create a 3D avatar chat experience with a humanoid robot.

## Current 3D Avatar

The project now uses a local `humanoid_robot.glb` file located in:

- `./assets/humanoid_robot.glb` - Main asset file
- `android/app/src/main/assets/humanoid_robot.glb` - Android bundle
- `ios/chatterBuddy/humanoid_robot.glb` - iOS bundle

## How to Replace with Your Own 3D Avatar

### Option 1: Ready Player Me (Recommended)

1. Visit [Ready Player Me](https://readyplayer.me/)
2. Take a selfie or upload a photo
3. Customize your avatar (hair, clothes, etc.)
4. Download the GLB file
5. Replace `humanoid_robot.glb` in the `assets/` directory
6. Update the file name in `src/components/Avatar3D.tsx`

### Option 2: Other Free 3D Model Sources

- **Renderpeople**: [renderpeople.com/free-3d-people](https://renderpeople.com/free-3d-people)
- **Free3D**: [free3d.com/3d-models/human](https://free3d.com/3d-models/human)
- **Mixamo**: [mixamo.com](https://mixamo.com) (Adobe account required)

## Installation

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Running the Project

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

## Usage

1. The app automatically loads the humanoid robot from `humanoid_robot.glb`
2. Check the console logs to see available animations
3. The avatar responds to talking/listening states with different animations
4. Enjoy your 3D chat buddy!

## Features

- 3D humanoid robot avatar with realistic lighting
- Dynamic animation system that adapts to available animations
- Talking and listening visual states
- Status indicators (muted, speaking, listening)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Automatic fallback to available animations

## Supported Formats

- GLB (recommended - currently used)
- GLTF
- FBX (with conversion)

## Animation System

The avatar automatically detects and uses available animations:

- **Talking**: Looks for 'talking', 'speak', 'idle', or first available animation
- **Listening**: Looks for 'listening', 'idle', or first available animation
- **Default**: Uses 'idle' or first available animation

Check the console logs to see what animations are available in your model!
